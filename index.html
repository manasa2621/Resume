    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
        Hello, I'm Manasa, a graduate with a strong passion for technology, continuous learning, personal development,
        and a powerful desire to leave a mark of my vision and ideas on the Web Development. I hold a First Class
        Masters degree from SJCE after 2 years of studying multiple domains within the IT industry, learning about SQL,
        Mern stack, UX Design, and, my favorite, Web Development, just to name a few.
    </p>
    <p>
        While I may be a fresh graduate, I am driven by an insatiable curiosity and a commitment to continuous learning.
        I am excited to apply the skills and knowledge I've acquired on this journey to contribute meaningfully to the
        dynamic and ever-evolving field of web development.
